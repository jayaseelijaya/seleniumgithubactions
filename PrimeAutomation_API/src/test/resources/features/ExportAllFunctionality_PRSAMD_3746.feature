@DUU_PRSAMD-3746_success
Scenario Outline: PRSAMD_3746-Scenario's with Valid Authorization and Request Body PUT API

				Given the base URL is entered for Exporting all functionality in Audit Logs by PUT API
				When user gives a valid "<Authorization>" and "<Token>" and "<SheetName>" <RowNumber> and triggers the PUTT API for Exporting all functionality in Audit Logs
				Then Response is generated with success status code while Exporting all functionality in Audit Logs PUT API
				And an attribute "responseMessage" is verified while Exporting all functionality in Audit Logs PUT API
