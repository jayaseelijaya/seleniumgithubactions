Scenario Outline: PRSAMD_2290- Scenario's with Valid Authorization and valid Request Parameters

				Given a user enters the valid URL for fetching new 3D model from updated mask without saving
				When the user gives a valid "<Authorization>" and "<Token>" with valid Test Data from "<SheetName>" and <RowNumber> and trigger GET API to fetch new 3D model from updated mask without saving
